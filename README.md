# i3config [![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

I like the way I can maniupulate windows and nvaigate between them. The absolute killer feature of i3 is how it handles [multi monitor setups](http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#multi_monitor). I like all the convenience a modern desktop environment brings you as well though. I want automounting, multimedia key handling, screenlocking, network management, program launchers and a nice panel with lots of little icons and stuff. In my [old setup](https://github.com/obestwalter/i3config/tree/stable-gnome-setup) I used a combination of i3 standalone with the `gnome-settings-deamon` and some self built little scripts. At the moment I am playing with [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org) as the host using i3 as the window manager to see how this turns out.
