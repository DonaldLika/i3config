# I am a little bit colour blind

So I often have problems with the standard colour choices of many programs and need to tweak them. This is often mindboggingly frustrating depending on what program you use and especially if you like dark themes. Therefore it is an important criterion for me, if the program I use either just has a palette I can live with or is customizable in all the right places. Ideally it uses the colour choices I make somewhere centrally and I don't have to bother.

## Solarized

[Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) by Ethan Schoonover is a very well thought out theme (with a dark and light variant that just inverts a subset of its colours). It also has the colour blind in mind and works very well for me, so I try to use it in many places.
