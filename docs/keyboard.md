# Keyboard

## Who is grabbing what?

I use XFCE and i3 as the window manager. So whatis defined in `xfce4-keyboard-settings` will take precedence even over what is configured in the i3 config. 

## layouts

I use xkeycaps to explore my keypboard

german layout: `xkeycaps -keyboard PC105DE`

us layout: `xkeycaps -keyboard PC105`
